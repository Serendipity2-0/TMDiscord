Help me create a comprehensive discord bot with help users play the game in which select characters from @characters folder and select one of the characters to play with. use discord.py build it with cogs. There will be more games to come. This game should be available only on DISCORD_V1SIM_CHANNEL_ID. Make the game extremely fun and engaging. Make sure save the game data in .db file remembering the users and the games they've played. Also have options to take feedback from the user at the end of the game. Use prefix commands, slash commands, modals and other appropriate interactive tools like dropdowns, buttons, etc., to make it user friendly.
